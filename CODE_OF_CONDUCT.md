# SHIP Programming Language Code of Conduct

The SHIP Programming Language project is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all contributors and participants, regardless of their background or experience level. We expect all individuals involved in the project to adhere to the following Code of Conduct. This code outlines our expectations for behavior and aims to create a positive and inclusive community for everyone.

## Be Respectful and Inclusive

Treat all individuals with respect, kindness, and empathy. Be considerate of differing viewpoints, experiences, and expertise. Value and celebrate diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to age, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, and socioeconomic status.

## Foster Collaboration and Open Communication

Encourage open and constructive discussions. Listen actively and attentively to others. Use welcoming and inclusive language. Be patient with others and provide support and guidance where needed. Strive to build a collaborative and supportive community.

## Maintain a Safe Environment

Harassment, discrimination, and any form of abuse or offensive behavior are strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, verbal, written, or physical actions that are derogatory, demeaning, or threatening. Respect others' personal boundaries and consent. If you witness or experience any violations of this code, please report it to the project maintainers immediately.

## Be Mindful of Your Words and Actions

Understand that your words and actions have consequences. Exercise caution and think about the potential impact they may have on others. Be responsible for your behavior and hold yourself accountable. If you make a mistake, apologize and take appropriate steps to correct it.

## Resolve Conflicts Appropriately

Disagreements and conflicts are a natural part of any community. However, it is important to address them respectfully and professionally. If you find yourself in a conflict, seek to understand the other person's perspective, find common ground, and work towards a resolution that benefits everyone involved.

## Reporting Violations

If you believe someone has violated the Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project maintainers. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and confidentially. The project maintainers are committed to taking appropriate actions in response to any verified violations.

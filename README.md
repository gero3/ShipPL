## SHIP Programming Language

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/example/ship-lang/blob/main/LICENSE)

SHIP Programming Language is a high-level programming language designed with strong abstraction and minimalistic syntax. It aims to provide a simplified and expressive coding experience while abstracting away the low-level details of computer systems.

### Features

- **Simplicity**: SHIP focuses on minimalism, providing a reduced set of language features and eliminating exceptions. This approach lowers the learning curve and improves code readability.
- **Abstraction**: SHIP abstracts away the intricacies of the underlying computer system, allowing developers to focus on problem-solving and high-level logic.
- **Control Flow**: SHIP offers essential control flow statements, including `if`, `if-else`, and `while`, for effective program flow control.
- **Numeric Precision**: SHIP supports integer numbers without decimal precision, simplifying mathematical operations and avoiding floating-point precision issues.
- **Unlimited Number Size**: SHIP imposes no limits on the size of numbers, enabling developers to work with large integers seamlessly.

### Getting Started

To get started with SHIP programming, follow the steps below:

1. Install the SHIP compiler and runtime from the [releases](https://github.com/gero3/ship-lang/releases) page.
2. Write your SHIP program using the SHIP programming language syntax.
3. Compile your SHIP program using the SHIP compiler.
4. Run the compiled program using the SHIP runtime environment.

### Examples

Here's a simple example of a SHIP program that calculates the sum of two numbers:

```SHIP
input number a;
input number b;
number sum;
sum = a + b;
output sum;
```
